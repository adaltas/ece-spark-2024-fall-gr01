# Data Engineering with Spark

## Lab 5: Machine Learning With Spark

### Prerequisites

- Connect to the [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)
- Upload the provided notebook
- If needed, upload the dataset

### Goals

Learn how to build ML models with Spark, analyzing AirBnB data:
- Learn how to properly prepare the data (feature vectorization)
- Observe the functioning of the estimators and the transformers
- Understand the steps of modeling with spark.ml during the demo with Linear Regression
- Learn how to join all the steps into a pipeline
- Apply your knowledge to create a Random Forest model on the same dataset

### Lab resources

- Notebook
- The data: `sf-listings-2019-03-06-clean.csv`

### Useful links

- [Spark MLlib Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html)

### TO DO

1. We will build Linear Regression model, predicting the price of the accommodations, during demo.
2. You will build Random Forest Regression model independently. Reuse the code from the Linear Regression. Use the same features or select new ones.
