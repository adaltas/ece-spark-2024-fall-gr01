# Spark

## Introduction

Apache Spark is a powerful open-source framework designed for fast and  versatile big data processing, enabling efficient large-scale data  manipulation and real-time analytics. In this course, you will learn how to leverage Spark's capabilities to process massive datasets and  perform complex data analysis tasks with ease.

## Educational goals

* Discover all the functionalities of Apache Spark and why it is everywhere.
* Understand the internals of Spark.
* Learn to use Spark for batch and streaming data analytics.
* Learn how to package a Spark application for production.
* Learn Machine Learning with MLlib.

## Prerequisites

Python programming knowledge, Linux/Unix shell basic knowledge.
